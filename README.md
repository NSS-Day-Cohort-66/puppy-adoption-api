# Puppy Adoption

We need to build a full stack application for Buford County that tracks which puppies are in the adoption centers, and record when someone adopts one, or more, puppies.

They want to see a list of all adoption agencies with the number of puppies next to the agency name.

When you click on an adoption center, a list of all puppies for that center should be listed. There should be an adopt button next to each one.

When the adopt button is clicked, a form should appear to enter in the owner information.

There should also be a button above the form labeled "Previous Adopter". If that button is clicked, the user should be able to choose an existing owner from a dropdown.

If a puppy is adopted, it should no longer appear in the application.
